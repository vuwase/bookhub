Book Hub: A React Discovery App (Summative Project)

This project aims to build a web application, Book Hub, for discovering books using React with TypeScript for the frontend and a backend API (JavaScript or Python) to manage book data.

## Project Goals

- Develop a user-friendly interface for browsing books.
- Implement functionalities for filtering and searching books by genre, author, publication date, etc.
- Utilize React and TypeScript to build a responsive and interactive frontend.
- Design a backend API to handle book data storage and retrieval.
- Integrate the frontend and backend for a seamless user experience.

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend (React with TypeScript):

- Implement components for displaying book listings, individual book details, and filtering options.
- Utilize TypeScript for type safety and improved code maintainability.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Integrate state management for filtering and user interactions (e.g., Redux, Context API).
- Implement functionalities like the search bar, genre filters, and sorting by various criteria (date, rating).
- Consider using a UI library like Material-UI or Bootstrap for a polished look.
- Handle user interactions for potential future functionalities like user accounts and book ratings.

### Backend (JavaScript or Python)

- Design and build a RESTful API to manage book data (CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Choose Node.js (JavaScript) or a Python framework like Django, Fast API or Flask for the backend.
- Implement a data storage solution (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store book information.
- Design API endpoints for fetching book listings, individual book details, and handling filter requests.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms if user accounts are planned for the future.

## Assessment Criteria

### React Skills (70%):

- Effective use of React components and lifecycle methods.
- Implementation of state management for filtering and user interactions.
- Utilization of TypeScript for type safety and code maintainability.
- Design of a responsive and user-friendly UI.
- Integration of search and filter functionalities for books.

### Backend Development (20%):

- Design and implementation of a RESTful API using Node.js or a Python framework.
- Connection to a chosen database for book data storage.
- Implementation of API endpoints for fetching and filtering book data.
- Proper handling of data requests and responses.

### Project Completion and Functionality (10%):

- Overall project functionality and meeting project goals.
- Documentation of code and functionalities.
- Error handling and user experience considerations.

## Additional Considerations:

- Implement pagination for displaying large sets of book listings.
- Consider user authentication and authorization for future functionalities like user accounts and book ratings.
- Deploy the application to a hosting platform for accessibility.

## Submission

This work will be submitted with a URL of well-documented GitHub Repositories / Repository (in case you put the frontend and backend under one repo).
